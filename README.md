# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## `docker-compose up`

**Note: This is to put in production!**

The Docker-compose will user Docker to contenarize our project build with `npm run build` and use this image to create a fresh new container under nginx. Then it will be up under the port 80.
